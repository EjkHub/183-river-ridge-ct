Hugo is different from Jekyll:
Jekyll "just the docs":

Had build caching issues
Needed Ctrl+Shift+B to clean/rebuild
Sometimes served stale content

Hugo:

Much cleaner - rebuilds fresh every time
No caching issues like Jekyll had
hugo server always serves current content
Faster and more reliable

If you ever need a "clean build" with Hugo:
Just stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart:

hugo server -D

That's it. Hugo doesn't have the build cache problems that Jekyll had.
The fact that your site worked immediately without any cleaning shows Hugo is much more reliable than the Jekyll setup was.
You don't need to worry about cleaning builds with Hugo - it handles that automatically and properly.RetryEso every change it seems brings up anake , do i care about it?EditNo, you don't care about ananke changes at all.
What's happening:

ananke = Just the theme files (like a template)
Your site = Your actual content and photos
Every time Hugo builds, it might touch theme files and Git sees "changes"

What to do:
Completely ignore the ananke repository changes.

Don't commit ananke changes
Don't worry about ananke errors
Only commit changes to 183-river-ridge-ct

Think of it like this:

ananke = The paint and brushes
183-river-ridge-ct = Your actual painting

You care about your painting, not about the paint manufacturer's issues.
Just focus on your main site (183-river-ridge-ct) and ignore everything about ananke. It's just noise.
The theme works fine for your site - you don't need to manage the theme's own repository.
